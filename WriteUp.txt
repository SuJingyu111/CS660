1. Describe any design decisions you made with a little more details. If you used something other than a nested-loops join,
   describe the tradeoffs of the algorithm you chose.
    -No design choices were made in Ex1.
    -In Ex2, in IntegerAggregator, we applied two HashMaps, one to store the information of tuples, another to store the
     times each grouping field occurred, in order to calculate average. In StringAggregator, since only COUNT operation is supported,
     there is only one map to record the count.
    -No design choices were made in Ex3.
