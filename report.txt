1. Describe any design decisions you made. [Please refer to the lab website for detailed requirements here.]
- No design choices were made in Ex1.
- In Ex2, in IntegerAggregator, we applied two HashMaps, one to store the information of tuples, another to store the
    times each grouping field occurred, in order to calculate average. In StringAggregator, since only COUNT operation is supported,
    there is only one map to record the count.
- No design choices were made in Ex3.
- No design choices were made in Ex4.
